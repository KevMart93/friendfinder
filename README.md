Homework 11 Week 13 - Modification of the Friend Finder assignment

# Are you a terrible person? Are you also a lonely person? 

Check out the Bad Influencer app! We can't help you be a better person, but we *can help* you be a terrible person, with a friend!

Just go to the website, click the survey button to get started, and then you will get your result of which terrible person should be your friend! Currently the app is hard-coded to only feature a few infamous characters, but the next step is to incorporate a database to save user input and have it function more like a typical dating site.
